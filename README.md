* The model accurately predicts 85% of instances
* When the model predicts a booking (class 1), it is less certain and has a higher chance of false positives
* The model is better at capturing instances where there is no booking (class 0) than instances where there is a booking (class 1)
* F1 score = 92% indicates good performance
* The model relies heavily on features like purchase_lead and length_of_stay to make predictions

# Cross-Validation

* Cross-validated Accuracy on Sample: 0.85 (+/- 0.01) 
* Cross-validated Accuracy on Full Dataset: 0.73 (+/- 0.20)
* The sample indicates a higher cross-validated accuracy compared to the full dataset
* There is more variability in the full dataset
